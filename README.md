# storage-filler
This script basically fills the drive you open it in. You can change whats being written in the script but after 2 minutes the script is too large for windows to open it, the file 
size aprox goes up 250,000MB every second so you dont have to leave it open long for it do so its thing. It can be easily removed howver just by deleating the file. You can impliment this into your already existing code or make it write the file in a random directory so its much harder to find a remove.
Enjoy :)
